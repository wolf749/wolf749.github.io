                <p>
                
                Hi, I’m Clayton Anderson and welcome to my website! <br><br>
                
                I’m a second-year PhD student at UC, San Diego studying Physics. Lately, my physics-computer science background has got me interested in a trio of problems in game design: (1) Procedural generation of terrain, (2) pathfinding on that terrain, and (3) level of detail.<br><br>
                
                Before I jump into that discussion though, let me include a little more about me…<br><br>
                I did my undergrad at UCSD graduating cum laude with double majors in Physics [specialization in condensed matter] and Mathematics-Computer Science [one major, two disciplines, a “joint” major]. Additionally, I did two years of undergrad research in The Contentti Group [physical chemistry], won the Malmberg Prize for prowess in experimental physics, and the Dean’s award in Physical Sciences.<br><br>
                
                I’ve got a passion for teaching [currently a teaching assistant for Mathematical and Computational Physics], and have assisted in a variety of classes in both Math and Physics departments.<br><br>
                
                My academic career has focused on the physical sciences but my interests are in no way limited to them. I find philosophy and history [currently re-reading Jared Diamond’s Guns, Germs, and Steel, but who isn’t these days?] particularly compelling.<br><br>
                
                Non-academics leads me to a passion for video games, and moreover, video game design.<br><br>
                
                Okay! On to terrain, pathfinding, and level of detail!<br><br>
